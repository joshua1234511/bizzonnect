## Entity Limit
Entity Limit allows administrators to restrict the number of entities of 
specific bundles that roles or users may create. For example, if a site has 
an "Advertiser" role that can create "advertisement" nodes, then the entity limit
administrator can restrict all users in that role to a specific number of nodes. 
He may also restrict users on a per-user basis.
